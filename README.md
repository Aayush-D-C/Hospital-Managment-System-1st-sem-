## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- CMake 3.16+
- One of:
  - Microsoft Visual Studio (with C/C++ tools) or Build Tools for VS
  - MinGW-w64 (for gcc and mingw32-make)

## Build and Run (MSVC / Visual Studio toolchain)

1. Open  x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS.
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   `
   cd C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\HMS
   `
3. Configure and build:
   `
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   `
4. Run (from the project root so relative data file paths work):
   `
   .\build\Debug\hms.exe
   `
   or if built as Release:
   `
   .\build\Release\hms.exe
   `

## Build and Run (MinGW)

1. Ensure gcc and cmake are available in PATH.
2. From PowerShell or Command Prompt:
   `
   cd C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\HMS\build
   cmake -G MinGW Makefiles ..
   cmake --build .
   `
3. Run (from project root):
   `
   .\build\hms.exe
   `

## Notes

- The current build compiles only src/main.c, which includes other .c files. This preserves the original behavior without changing the code.
- The app uses Windows console APIs and conio.h, so it is Windows-only.
- Data files are stored under data/. Ensure you run the executable from the project root so relative paths resolve.

## Troubleshooting

- If cmake is not recognized, install CMake from the official site and add it to PATH.
- If MSVC build tools are missing, install Visual Studio (Desktop development with C++) or the standalone Build Tools.
- If MinGW build fails, verify you used the MinGW Makefiles generator and that gcc/g++ are in PATH.
- For permission issues, avoid running from protected directories; your current path under the user profile is fine.

## Next Steps (Optional)

- Compile each .c as a separate translation unit and stop including .c files.
- Add headers in an include/ folder and separate UI, core logic, and storage.
- Improve input handling and storage format.
